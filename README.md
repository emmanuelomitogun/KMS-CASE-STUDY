## 🚀 Executive Summary

From 2009 to 2012, Kultra Mega Stores' Abuja division processed thousands of transactions — but numbers alone don’t tell the full story.

What looked like strong sales on the surface was actually masking deeper inefficiencies in logistics, customer management, and regional strategy. This report uncovers where the business is thriving and where it’s quietly bleeding — then offers clear, practical fixes.

Using SQL, Power BI, and real business context, we peeled back the layers to answer one big question: *How can KMS grow smarter, not just bigger?*

## 🏢 Company Background & Business Context

Kultra Mega Stores is one of Nigeria’s leading retailers in office furniture and supplies, serving individuals, small businesses, and large corporations. While headquartered in Lagos, the Abuja division acts as a key regional arm.

Despite stable sales, senior leadership raised concerns:

* Are we prioritizing the right customers?
* Why are margins tightening?
* Are returns and shipping costs quietly eroding profit?

This project was commissioned to get clarity — not just to describe the data, but to use it as a tool for better decision-making.

## 📊 Methodology & Analytical Approach

This wasn't just an Excel crunch job. The project combined:

* **SQL** for data wrangling, segmentation, and advanced filtering  
* **Power BI** for dynamic dashboards, KPI tracking, and visual storytelling  
* **Business framing** to turn findings into actions leadership could take  

We used five analytical lenses:

1. **Order Patterns**: Which products, which regions, how often, and how fast?
2. **Customer Segmentation**: Who brings value, who costs us more than they give?
3. **Product Performance**: What’s hot, what’s dragging?
4. **Shipping & Logistics**: Are we paying premium prices for low-priority deliveries?
5. **Return Behavior**: What are customers telling us by what they send back?

## 📈 Case Scenario I: Sales & Logistics Performance

### 1. Category Sales Performance  
Technology products led the charge, accounting for over ₦5.9M — nearly half of all revenue. But relying so heavily on one product class introduces risk. We recommended diversifying revenue through bundled offers and category cross-selling.

### 2.  Regional Disparities  
Top regions like Ontario outperformed weak zones like Nunavut and Yukon. These gaps suggest market misalignment or underinvestment. We flagged specific areas for targeted expansion.

### 3.  Underperforming Product Lines in Strong Regions  
Despite Ontario's strong performance, appliance sales lagged badly there. A classic case of product-market mismatch. It’s not just about volume—it’s about *relevance*.

### 4.  Untapped Customer Value  
The bottom 10 customers were quiet — one-time buyers with low order value. We recommended personalized outreach and loyalty nudges to pull them into deeper engagement.

### 5.  Shipping Costs Out of Control  
Delivery trucks, meant to be cheap, ended up being the most expensive method. Express Air was often used for low-priority orders. We flagged this as a cost leak and proposed automated shipping-tier logic.

---

## 👥 Case Scenario II: Customer Insights & Return Behavior

### 6.  High-Value Customers Deserve VIP Treatment  
A handful of customers consistently purchased large volumes, often in high-margin categories. We recommended creating a VIP program with early product access and priority support.

### 7.  Small Business = Big Potential  
One small business customer outperformed many corporates. It broke assumptions and revealed an opportunity: with the right package, small businesses could become power users.

### 8.  Corporate Loyalty, Done Right  
High-frequency orders from a few corporate clients pointed to automation potential. A subscription model or auto-replenishment service could reduce friction and boost retention.

### 9.  Profit-Optimized Consumer Behavior  
The most profitable consumer didn’t just buy a lot — they bought smart. Studying their behavior could help craft smarter product recommendations for others.

### 10.  Return Risks  
Consumers returned products most frequently. Quality? Mismatched expectations? We recommended surveying return reasons, improving descriptions, and flagging products with higher return rates.

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

The goal isn’t just to do more — it’s to do the right things in the right order. Based on what we uncovered, we grouped our actions into three clear phases.

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Quick Wins (0–3 Months)

**Automate Shipping Logic**  
Fix the mismatch between shipping method and order type. We’re using Express Air for low-priority orders — a costly mistake. Automate smarter rules.

**Reactivate Dormant Customers**  
Some customers bought once and vanished. A few personalized nudges and discounts can bring them back into the funnel.

**Improve Returns Visibility**  
We don’t know *why* customers return products. Add return reasons, gather feedback, and pinpoint issues faster.

---

### 🚧 Phase 2: Foundational Growth (3–12 Months)

**Build Loyalty Programs for High-Value Customers**  
The top 5–10 customers bring in a large share of profit. Treat them like royalty: offer perks, early access, and account management.

**Expand into Underserved Regions**  
Yukon, Nunavut, and others show low sales. Is it market disinterest or poor reach? Test localized strategies and find out.

**Empower Small Businesses**  
One small biz outperformed corporates. Build out offerings for this segment: flexible credit, bundles, and better support.

---

### 🚀 Phase 3: Long-Term Strategy (12+ Months)

**Diversify Beyond Technology**  
Tech brings half the revenue. Great — but risky. Grow other categories and balance the revenue mix.

**Invest in Smart Logistics Tools**  
Shipping decisions are still manual. Introduce intelligent systems that optimize cost, priority, and routes.

**Build a Customer Lifetime Value Engine**  
Track CLV across segments. Know who to invest in, who to win back, and how to grow smartly — not randomly.

---

### 🧠 Why This Phased Approach?

- **Phase 1**: Stop the bleeding (shipping, returns, dormant users)
- **Phase 2**: Build structure (loyalty, regional growth, SMB programs)
- **Phase 3**: Scale with strategy (diversification, automation, CLV)

This isn't a to-do list — it’s a strategy built around business logic, cost control, and sustainable growth.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

KMS Abuja is in a strong position — but not an unshakable one.

The data showed promise and problems living side-by-side. This report didn’t just highlight gaps — it pointed to concrete actions that could make a real difference in cost savings, revenue growth, and customer retention.

That’s the power of business intelligence when it's done right: **less noise, more clarity.**
